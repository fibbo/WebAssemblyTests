  <h1>General findings</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects created on the JavaScript side passed to WASM are always copies. If an object has been created in WASM via a WASM function call from JavaScript the c/c++ concept
      of passing by value or passing by reference hold.
    </li>
    <li>Allocating memory in JavaScript and passing it to the WASM memory is very slow and should not be done (also I don't think there is any need for it)</li>
    <li>Side modules cannot contain the EM_ASM macro (not supported yet). E.g. our license key validation uses this macro -> Has to be in the main module (shouldn't be a problem)</li>
    <li>Allocations and deallocations with new/delete respectively seem to about 20% slower if going across modules</li>
    <li>Other functions with stack allocations and or move operations don't seem to suffer from the same and perform only with minor differences, the way going across modules
      being a little bit slower.
    </li>
  </ul>
